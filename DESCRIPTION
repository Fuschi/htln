Description: Tools for modelling zero-inflated and heavy-tailed data using a hurdle
    model with a truncated log-normal distribution on the log-transformed scale.
    Designed for datasets such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) counts after a
    log(x + 1) transformation. Includes functions for maximum likelihood estimation,
    density evaluation, quantile computation, and random generation.
